1. the exhaustive case disjunction under which the key com- puted by the responder Alex is secret;
2. the exhaustive case disjunction under which the key com- puted by the initiator Blake is secret;
1. IKB was compromised before the completion of the key exchange (this is to be expected, this is essentially a malicious A case).
2. IKB was compromised after the key exchange, as well as some SPKb, and either KEMs are broken or the corre- sponding PQSPKB has been compromised (the attacker just need to send a malicious OPK here to be able to compute all the values).
3. DH was broken before the key exchange (this is similar to case 1).
1. IKA was compromised before the exchange ( allows the impersonation of Alex).
2. Some SPKB was compromised before the exchange (knowing SPKB allows to impersonate A).
3. DH has been broken before the exchange. The second compromise case here is the most interesting one. Indeed, it means that Signal is suceptible to a form of ephemeral key compromise impersonation: compromising the ephemeral SPKB secret of Blake allows to impersonate anybody to Blake. This is natural with the design of Signal, as Alex only authenticates by using a long term DH share combined with the SPKB. Theorem 9 (Symbolic Initiator Secrecy). The key SKB com- puted by the initiator Blake is secret, unless:
1. IKA was compromised before the communication. (this allows a full impersonation of Alex)
2. Some SPKB was compromised before the communica- tion. (more surprisingly, but inevitably, this allows a full impersonation of any Alex)
3. IKB, SPKB and PQSPKB are compromised after the com- munication, and either no OPK was used or it was com- promised. (all secret material of A is leaked here, so this is a very natural case)
4. IKB and SPKB are compromised after the communication, and KEMs are broken, and either no OPK was used or it was compromised. (similar to 3)
5. DH was broken before the exchange (naturally breaks everything)
6. DH was broken after the exchange, and the PQSPKB used by the responder was compromised (similar to 3)
1. peer-authentication: directly implied by Theorem 8, where authentication holds unless there is a compromise.
3. resistance to key compromise impersonation: implied by Theorem 8, as authentication holds even if IKB was compromised.

11. Let A be an m×n matrix; let Ai,j be the ele- ment at row i and column j, and let Ai indicate the i-th row vector. The Frobenius matrix of A is: ∥A∥F = s m ∑ i=1 n ∑ j=1 |Ai,j|2 = s m ∑ i=1 ∥Ai∥2 , where ∥v∥is the L2 norm of a vector v. Corollary
7. The Bayes security of DP-SGD against record- level MIA (Game 2) is: β∗≥1−erf p √ T √ 2σ ! −O √pT σ  . Proof. Observe that in the MIA threat model (Game 2) f(z∗ s) = s is a bijection. Then: ∆f = max z∗ 0,z∗ 1∈D∥¯g(z∗ 0)−¯g(z∗ 1)∥F = max z∗ 0,z∗ 1∈D s T ∑ t=1 ∥¯gt(z∗ 0)−¯gt(z∗ 1)∥2 ≤2C √ T . Applying Theorem 6 concludes the proof. Corollary
