1. We would like to emphasize that any constructions involving (structured) binary vectors can gain adaptive security through our approach. 1.7. Related Works As we provide a ZKAoK protocol for Paillier, we now review and compare existing ZKPs customized for Paillier. Existing works can be mainly divided into two categories, one focuses on proving the validity of an RSA modulus (i.e., Paillier public key) while the other focuses on proving plaintext relations (including range). We use pk = N to denote a Paillier public key and PL.Encpk(m; r) to denote Paillier encryption of message m with randomness r. Proving the Validity of A Paillier Public Key. [75] ﬁrst proposed a ZKP on a number that is the product of two safe prime integers. It can be directly used for proving a valid Paillier public key.
[76] also sketched the folklore method of proving the validity of an RSA modulus where it proves that gcd(N, φ(N)) =
1. Although the standard Paillier public key is generated from two prime numbers, this statement still sufﬁces to provide all properties of Pail- lier (e.g., additive homomorphism) through this requirement (see
[33] Sec. 3.1). Besides,
[36] also suggests combining methods in
[77] and
[78] for proving an RSA composite (we refer
[36] for more detailed discussions). This category of proofs is orthogonal to ours. Looking ahead, in our protocol, P2 (veriﬁer) should request P1 (prover) to provide a proof that: 1). the Paillier encryption key N is the product of two primes p and q and 2). p and q are sufﬁciently large. The ﬁrst condition can be proved using the protocol introduced in Section 5.2 of [75]. The second can be achieved by proving the knowledge of a discrete logarithm that lies in a given range, utilizing techniques in Section 2.2 of [75], or [79]. Proving Paillier Plaintexts Relation. Another class mainly focuses on proving relations among Paillier plain- texts.
[35] gives a construction on proving knowledge of an encrypted plaintext. For proving that the plaintext is 0, [10] gives constructions which is actually a proof of Nth power in Paillier. For proving multiplicative relations among Paillier plaintexts,
[10] gives constructions on Πmul. That is, we can prove that a message is the product of two other messages. For proving a more advanced relation, a sequence of powers,
[36] constructs Πpow based on Πmul. In [33], they bridged two different worlds, Paillier encryption and Elliptic curve groups, and proposed a zero-knowledge proof for language Rpl−ec. That is, it can prove that the message in a given Paillier ciphertext is the discrete log of a given Elliptic curve point. Later,
[34] gives constructions on Paillier and Pedersen commitments. It proves that the same value is used in encryption and commitment schemes. Besides, [33] and
[34] also gave a range proof that is customized for Paillier, where
[33] was adapted from the range proof in [54]. However, to achieve efﬁciency, both of them can only give range proofs with slack (i.e., inexact proofs). For devising an exact range proof in Paillier, one may utilize a tight range proof, such as [49], [54], with some adaption. Since these range proofs do not work on Paillier, an integer commitment scheme
[80] is needed as a bridge. In more detail, let Enc(x) be the Paillier encryption of x. Let CMTI be an integer commitment scheme in which efﬁcient range proofs exist. To prove that x lies in an exact range, the prover ﬁrst produces commitments c1 := Enc(x) and c2 := CMTI(x). He then engages the following protocols to prove i) Πc1: c1 is a Paillier encryption of x ii) Πc2: the same value, x, is committed in c2 iii) Πrange: the committed value in c2 is in some range. Πrange can be achieved by invoking the existing range proofs on c2. Although the range proof is efﬁcient, auxiliary commitments may give a lower bound on the proof size. 1.8.

1. An Arithmetic Circuit The knowledge of wire assignment to satisfy the circuit directly translates to the assignment of variables satisfying the set of constraints. There are two types of constraints, namely, multiplication and linear constraints. A multipli- cation constraint is of the form ax ∗bx = cx while a linear constraint is of the form P x w(a) x ax + P x w(b) x bx = P x w(c) x cx + c0, where constants {w(a) x , w(b) x , w(c) x , c0} de- pend solely on the circuit and the public values while {ax, bx, cx} are the wire assignments (depends on values known only to the prover, or say witness). Note also that only wires of multiplication gates of intermediate values are labeled. Wires of addition gates and multiplication gates with public inputs (constants) are handled by linear con- straints. To prove that the prover knows some input such that the output of the circuit above is some speciﬁc number, say 0, one can add another linear constraint as c3 = 0. Bootle et al.
[46] showed how to transform a circuit into constraints, and their zero-knowledge argument system works directly over a set of constraints. Constraints for Correctness of Paillier Encryption. Our ﬁrst contribution is a (compact) set of constraints hand- crafted to represent correct encryption. The prover wants to prove that he knows a pair, (m, r), satisfying c = (1+N)m· rN mod N 2, which can be computed as c = (1+mN)·rN mod N 2, where N is an RSA modulus. Note that (1+mN) is readily a linear constraint. We focus on our set of con- straints for representing rN. Let α = ⌈log N⌉and {nα, . . . , n2, n1} be the binary decomposition of N. That is, N = 2α−1·nα+· · ·+2·n2+n1. Deﬁne a sequence ˜R = { ˜R1 = r, ˜R2 = r2, . . . , ˜Rα = r2α−1}. Let β be the hamming weight of N. Deﬁne an index set ˜D = {γ|nγ = 1}, including all index positions of 1’s in the decomposition of N. We have | ˜D| = β. We use d1, . . ., dβ to denote elements of ˜D with di < dj if i < j. Deﬁne sequence ˜S = { ˜S1, . . . , ˜Sβ} such that ˜S1 = ˜Rd1, ˜Sk = ˜Sk−1 · ˜Rdk for k ∈[2, β]. We have ˜Sβ = rN since ˜R1 = r. Note that ˜R, ˜S are the intermediate values when we calculate rN from r using the square-and-multiply algorithm. One can uniquely compute (α, β, ˜D) from N. As an example, consider N = 11, which can be rep- resented as 1011 in binary. Then α = 4 and β = 3. To compute r11, the sequence ˜R is set as, ˜R = { ˜R1 = r, ˜R2 = r2, ˜R3 = r4, ˜R4 = r8}. The sequence ˜D is, ˜D = {d1 = 1, d2 = 2, d3 = 4}. We have ˜S = { ˜S1 = ˜R1 = r, ˜S2 = ˜S1 · ˜R2 = r3, ˜S3 = ˜S2 · ˜R4 = r11}. The correctness of ˜R and ˜S implies that rN is computed correctly. Thus, correct encryption of Paillier ciphertext can be represented using the following constraints. c = `T ∗˜Sβ `T = 1 + m ∗N ˜R1 = r //for clarity ˜Ri+1 = ˜Ri ∗˜Ri i ∈[1, α −1] ˜S1 = ˜Rd1 //for clarity ˜Sk = ˜Sk−1 ∗˜Rdk k ∈[2, β] (1) For ease of writing, we deﬁne the above set of con- straints as Const{c,m,r}, with respect to c, m, and r. Note that ˜R1, r (resp. ˜S1, ˜Rd1) can be combined into one wit- 1817 Authorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore. Downloaded on December 19,2025 at 01:34:51 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. ness. Thus, Const{c,m,r} contains α + β −1 multiplication constraints and one linear constraint. Proof that A Message Is Binary. Very often, we need to prove that a variable in the constraint is binary. For example, we need to prove that c is the encryption of a binary message m. If the constraints are deﬁned over a prime ﬁeld, adding the following constraint is sufﬁcient: m ∗(m −1) = 0. However, we work in ZN 2 and the above constraint does not guarantee that m is binary. According to the Chinese Reminder Theorem, there are 4 values satisfying this con- straint:          m = 0 m = 1 m = q2 · [(q2)−1 mod p2] (= X) m = p2 · [(p2)−1 mod q2] (= Y ), One of the core technical contributions of this work is an innovative statistical argument to ensure that m is binary. Speciﬁcally, our solution requires that the prover commits a random “noise” value, R′, chosen from a relatively small range L5, say, L := {1, . . . , 2256}. The veriﬁer chooses a random challenge, ℓ∈{0, 1}, and the prover is required to give L′ := ℓm+R′, along with a proof that L′ is computed correctly. For simplicity, we will also use Paillier encryption for the “commitment” of R′. The proof that L′ is correctly computed can be represented by a linear constraint. More concretely, the prover computes and sends c′ = (1+N)R′ ∗r′N mod N 2 to the veriﬁer, who replies with a challenge bit ℓ, and the prover sends L′ along with a proof that the following constraints are satisﬁed: Const{c,m,r} m ∗(m −1) = 0 ℓ∗m + R′ = L′ Const{c′,R′,r′}. Besides checking the proof, the veriﬁer also checks whether L′ ≤max{L} +
1. For an honest prover, a statistical argument ensures L′ leaks negligible information about m, since R′ is much larger than m. A cheating prover may use X or Y as a witness. Recall that X and Y are large (on the order of p2 or q2), the only way for a cheating prover to ensure L′ := ℓ∗m + R′ ≤max{L} + 1 is to guess ℓ and pick R′ accordingly. If he/she guesses ℓ= 1, he/she should pick a large R′ such that X (or Y ) plus R′ modulo N 2 is within the expected range. Likewise, if he/she guesses ℓ= 0, he/she should pick a small R′, i.e., R′ ≤max{L}+1. Therefore, with probability 1/2, a cheating prover will be caught. To amplify soundness, the above process could be repeated κ times (say κ = 128). Proof that Polynomially Many Messages are Binary. Our method can be extended to prove that polynomially many witnesses are binary. Speciﬁcally, assume we would like to prove that there are Np ciphertexts, each of which encrypts a binary message. We use (mi, ci) to denote one
1. Constraints in our ﬁnal solution are given below: Const{ci,mi,ri} X s 232(s−1)b(i) 32(s−1) = mi b(i) 32(s−1) ∗(b(i) 32(s−1) −1) = 0 Const{c′ j,R′ j,r′ j} X i,s ℓ(i) j,32(s−1)b(i) 32(s−1) + R′ j = L′ j X s X k 232(k−1)+s−1 · b15(t−1)+k 32(s−1) = m∗ t Const{c∗ t ,m∗ t ,r∗ t }, where j ∈[1, κ], s ∈[1, 64], k ∈[1, 15], i ∈[1, Np] and t ∈[1, Np 15 ]. We use ℓ(i) j,32(s−1) to indicate the random challenges. Since there are more bits now in the computation of L′ j, range L will be slightly enlarged, say, L := {0, 2281}.
3. Preliminaries In what follows, we use an adversary A as an interac- tive probabilistic polynomial time Turing Machine, whose running time is polynomial in the security parameter λ. Assumptions. Let Setup be an algorithm outputting (G, N 2, g), with input 1λ. G is the description of a ﬁnite cyclic group with composite order N 2, where N = pq is a RSA modulus, N 2 = λ and g is the generator6. Deﬁnition 3.1. (Discrete Logarithm Relation Assumption on Composite Group). This assumption holds if for all n ≥1 and non-uniform PPT adversaries A, Pr   ∃ai ̸= 0 (G, N 2, g) ←Setup(1λ), and g1, . . . , gn ←G , ga0 Qn i=1 gai i = 1 a0, . . . , an ←A(G, N 2, g, {gi}i)  ≈0, relative to Setup. We say ga0 Qn i=1 gai i = 1 a non-trivial discrete log relation between g1, . . . , gn. It is known that it is equivalent to the discrete logarithm assumption. Pedersen Commitment. In our protocol, we require a Pedersen commitment scheme, which works over the group G of Deﬁnition 3.1. Informally, it contains 2 polynomial algorithms PDC = (PDC.Gen, PDC.Com) where the com- mitment has the form ct = gm · hr. We use a variant, that allows to commit to multiple values at once. Its formal deﬁnition is given in

4. (LSSS [4].) A secret sharing scheme over a set of parties Ωis called linear if there exists an ℓˆ n matrix M and a label function ρ : rℓs ÞÑ Ω4 such that for any random vector v “ ps, y2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , ynq P Zn p, where s represents the secret, we have that Mv shares the secret s to parties, and pMvqi belongs to the party ρpiq. Usually, the secret scheme is denoted as a pair pM, ρq. Let pM, ρq be a LSSS scheme, then for any authorized set A Ă Ω, (1) there exists a set of valid shares λ “ tλi P ZpuiPI, where I “ ti : ρpiq P Au; and (2) there exists an efficient algorithm
[25] to calculate a set of constants w “ twi P ZpuiPI to recover the secret from the valid shares by ř iPI wiλi “ s. Here we only assume the existence of such constants. Refer to
[25] for the detailed algorithm, which can be optimized in real implementations. B. ABE-2OD Security Models and Proofs Assumption
1. (KEA [5]). For any adversary A that takes g1{x, g1{y and returns pu, vq with vy “ ux, then there exists an “extractor” E, which given same inputs as A and returns t such that pg1{xqt “ u, pg1{yqt “ v. Without loss of generality, we let AdvKEA A,E p1λq “ PrrEpg1{x, g1{y, pg1{xqt, pg1{yqtq ‰ ts. Specifically, KEA holds if for every adversary A there exists an extractor E and a negligible error function ν such that AdvKEA A,E p1λq ď νpλq.

Restrictions apply. B.1. Security Models We first describe the selective indistinguishability secu- rity experiment EXPsIND-ATK Π,A p1λq between a challenger and a PPT adversary A in Figure
8. We define two security EXPsIND-ATK Π,A p1λq pM˚, ρ˚q Ð Ap1λ, Ωq; // Initialization T B :“ H; k :“ 0; (PK, MSK) Ð Π.Setupp1λ, Ωq; // Setup pM0, M1q Ð AOpPKq; // Query 1 b Ð t0, 1u, C˚ Ð Π.Enc ` PK, Mb, pM˚, ρ˚q ˘ ; // Challenge b1 Ð AOpPK, C˚q; // Query 2 and Guess return 1 if b1 “ b, else return 0. Figure 8: Experiment for ABE-2OD models (i.e. ATK P {CDA, CHA}), which are different in the oracles allowed by A. O “ # tOKeyGen, OCorruptDK, OTransform2u ATK = CDA; tOKeyGen, OCorruptDK, OCorruptHK, ODecu ATK = CHA; sIND-CDA. To capture the adversary’s ability, the sIND-CDA model follows the experiment EXPsIND-CDA Π,A p1λq and allows A to query the set of oracle defined as above. Specifically, these oracles are described as follows. ‚ OKeyGenpMSK,¨q is a key generation oracle that allows A to query an attribute set Ak Ă Ω. For each query, it runs KeyGen pMSK, Akq to obtain the key triple (TKk, HKk, DKk) and responds A with TKk. Besides, it records TBrks :“ pAk, TKk, HKk, DKkq and updates k Ð k `1. ‚ OCorruptDKp¨q is a corruption oracle that allows A to query an index i. If TBris is not defined, it outputs K; otherwise fetches pAi, TKi, HKi, DKiq and forwards DKi to A. ‚ OTransform2p¨,¨q is the second stage transformation ora- cle that allows A to query an index i and a partially transformed ciphertext PTC. If TBris is not defined, it outputs K; otherwise, retrieves Ai and HKi. If the query is in the second query phase and A $ pM˚, ρ˚q, it forwards K to A; otherwise, sends the transformed result of Transform2 pHKi, PTCq to A. Definition
6. (sIND-CHA for ABE-2OD). An ABE-2OD scheme is sIND-CHA if for any PPT adversary A, the following advantage is negligible. AdvsIND-CHA Π,A p1λq “ ˇˇˇˇPr “ EXPsIND-CHA Π,A p1λq “ 1 ‰ ´ 1 2 ˇˇˇˇ . B.2. Proof of THEOREM 1 Proof. Suppose there exists a PPT adversary A who has a non-negligible advantage in the game of sIND-CDA, we build a simulator B that calls A as a subroutine to break the Green’s OABE scheme (i.e., ΠOABE). The simulation consists of six phases and the details are as follows. Init. The simulator B runs a copy of A. A determines an LSSS-style policy pM˚, ρ˚q, which is then submitted by B for challenging. Setup. Receiving a public parameter PK from ΠOABE’s challenger, B forwards PK to the adversary, where PK “ pg, e pg, gqα , ga, H, H1, H2q . Note that MSK is unknown to B. Query Phase
1. B initializes TB :“ H, k :“ 0, and an H-list. Then B answers the queries from A as follows. OKeyGenpMSK,¨q: Receiving an attribute set A as input, B forwards A to ΠOABE’s key generation oracle and then obtains the transformation key Ď TK in ΠOABE, i.e., there exist pK1, L1, tK1 yuyPAq such that Ď TK “ ´ sK “ pK1q 1 β , sL “ pL1q 1 β , t sKy “ pK1 yq 1 β uxPA ¯ where β is also unknown to B. Then B chooses random numbers t1 1, t1 2, γ1, γ2 P Zp, and simulates as follows. ‚ If A & pM˚, ρ˚q, B first queries ΠOABE’s key generation oracle to obtain β. Then B extracts pK1, L1, tK1 yuyPAq from Ď TK. Then B calculates TK = pTK1, TK2q, where each TKi (i P t1, 2u) is defined K “ ´ K1 ¨ pgaqt1 i ¯ 1 γiβ , L “ ´ L1 ¨ gt1 i ¯ 1 γiβ , tKy “ ´ K1 yH1pyqt1 i ¯ 1 γiβ uyPA. Let ¯t be the randomness hidden in Ď TK, the randomness in TKi (i P t1, 2u) is ti “ ¯t ` t1 i. Therefore it perfectly simulates the transformation key. Besides B sets HK “ pγ1, γ2q and DK “ β. 3123 Authorized licensed use limited to: BOSTON UNIVERSITY. Downloaded on October 10,2025 at 13:20:57 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. ‚ Otherwise, A $ pM˚, ρ˚q, B cannot query ΠOABE’s key generation oracle to obtain β. Instead, B chooses a ran- dom β˚ as the fake DK. B calculates TK = pTK1, TK2q, where each TKi (i P t1, 2u) is defined K “ ´ sK ¨ pgaqt1 i ¯ 1 γiβ˚ , L “ ´ sL ¨ gt1 i ¯ 1 γiβ˚ , tKy “ ´ sK1 yH1pyqt1 i ¯ 1 γiβ˚ uyPA. Note that he randomness in TKi (i P t1, 2u) is ti “ ¯t ` β ¨ t1 i. Besides B sets HK “ pγ1, γ2q and DK “ β˚. The pair (TK, HK, DK) is not well-formed, but the (TK, DK) is properly distributed from A’s view. Finally, B sets TBrks :“ tA, TK, HK, DKu, k Ð k`1, and forwards TK to A. OCorruptDKp¨q: Receiving an index i from A, it outputs error symbol K if TBris is not defined; otherwise it fetches DK from TBris and forwards DK to A. GTransform2p¨,¨q: Receiving an index i and a partially trans- formed ciphertext PTC, B answers A’s query as follows. ‚ If A & pM˚, ρ˚q, B fetches corresponding (TK, HK, DK) from TB. Since (TK, HK, DK) is a well-formed key tuple, B runs ABE-2DO’s Transform2 and sends the transformed result to A. ‚ Otherwise, A $ pM˚, ρ˚q, B does not maintain the well-formed key tuple in this case. B also fetches cor- responding (TK, HK = pγ1, γ2q, DK = β˚) from TB. Let PTC “ pC, C1, CP 1, CP 2q. In sIND-CDA, the relation Cγ1 P 1 “ Cγ2 P 2 always holds. Without loss of generality, let CP 1 “ ´ epg, gq αs βγ1 ¯t , CP 2 “ ´ epg, gq αs βγ2 ¯t . B also generates a random cipher pC via setting the randomness s “ 1 during encryption and uses the cor- responding TK to generate a y PTC “ p pC, x C1, y CP 1, y CP 2q such that y CP 1 “ epg, gq α βγ1 , y CP 2 “ epg, gq α βγ2 . From KEA assumption, given y PTC “ pCP 1, CP 2, y CP 1, y CP 2q, there exists an extractor that ex- tract s¨t from the tuple. B calculates Ď C2 “ pepg, gqαq s¨t β˚ . Finally, B returns pT “ C, T 1 “ C1, T 2 “ Ď C2q. Challenge. Receiving a message pair pM0, M1q from A, B forwards M0 and M1 to ΠOABE’s challenger, which responds by a ciphertext C˚. Finally it passes C˚ to A. Note that the bit b of ΠOABE’s challenger is unknown to B. Query Phase
2. B continues to answer queries from A as in Query Phase 1, except that: in the GTransform2p¨,¨q query, if A $ pM˚, ρ˚q, it forwards K to A. Guess. Receiving a bit b1 from A, B eventually outputs the same bit b1 as its guess. This ends the simulation. In case A $ pM˚, ρ˚q, A always generates a proper TC for A. Obliviously, it perfectly simulates the game. We have AdvsIND-CDA Π,A ď AdvsIND-CPA ΠOABE,B ` qT ¨ AdvKEA A,E , where AdvsIND-CPA ΠOABE,B is advantage of B wins ΠOABE’s CPA security game and qT is the number of queries to the GTransform2p¨,¨q oracle. Therefore, the advantage of breaking the sIND-CDA is negligible, which completes the proof. B.3. Proof Sketch of THEOREM 2 Proof. ABE-2OD splits OABE’s secret key into two parts: γ-part (γ1, γ2) and β-part. In case of corrupted HK attacks, we can view the β as the secret key in OABE, and the combination of TK and γ-part as the transformation key in OABE. Therefore, ABE-2OD’s sIND-CHA security directly follows OABE’s RCCA security. C. HR-ABE’s Security Models and Its Proofs C.1. The sIND-ColA model.

Figure 9: Experiment of the sIND-ColA for HR-ABE Figure 9 presents an experiment between a challenger and an adversary A for defining selective indistinguishabil- ity against collusion attacks (sIND-ColA). The experiment EXPsIND-ColA ΠG,A allows the adversary A to query a set of oracle O = {OJoin, ORev, OUpd, OCorrupt} and G “ tGTransform2u. Let AID denote the attribute set of DU ID. We define Tsat :“ tID : ID P U ^ AID $ pM˚, ρ˚qu, Tcor :“ tID : ID P U ^ ID’s DK was corruptedu. A can adaptively query join oracle OJoin, revocation oracle ORev, and update oracle OUpd to determine the set of DUs that are in the latest UL at each time interval. The corruption oracle OCorrupt allows A to obtain the decryption key DK of a DU and GTransform2 is the transformation oracle that inputs A’s query pID, PTCq and outputs the transformed ciphertext TC to A. Specifically, these oracles are defined as follows. ‚ OJoinpMSK,UL,¨,¨q is a join oracle that allows A to query an identity ID and an attribute set A. It runs pUL, pTK, RK, DKqq Ð Join pMSK, UL, ID, Aq, and sets TBrIDs :“ pA, TK, RK, DKq and returns TK to A. ‚ ORevpUL,¨q is a revocation oracle that allows A to query an identity ID. For each query, it runs Rev pUL, IDq to obtain a new DU list UL. 3124 Authorized licensed use limited to: BOSTON UNIVERSITY. Downloaded on October 10,2025 at 13:20:57 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. ‚ OUpdpMSK,UL,¨,¨q is a state update oracle that allows A to query a state sti´1, and a time interval index i. For each query, it responds A with a new state sti at i-th time interval, where sti Ð Update pMSK, sti´1, UL, iq. ‚ OCorruptp¨q is a corruption oracle that allows A to query an identity ID. If TBrIDs is not defined, it outputs error symbol K; otherwise it fetches pA, TK, RK, DKq Ð TBrIDs and forwards DK to A. If the query is in the second query phase and A $ pM˚, ρ˚q, it outputs K. ‚ GTransform2p¨,¨q is the transformation oracle that allows A to query an ID and a PTC. It invokes Transform2 and forwards the result to A. Definition

[31] and below we provide a proof sketch of THEOREM
3. We start the proof by defining three games: Game0, Game1, and Game2. Let Ei denotes the event that A wins in Gamei. In detail, the two games are defined as follows. ‚ Game0. This game is the original sIND-COlA game. ‚ Game1. This game is the same as Game0, except that if the adversary is able to provide a different state st˚ i “ pσ˚, UL˚ i , i˚q from that maintained by the challenger sti “ pσ, ULi, iq then the challenger outputs a random bit and aborts the game. ‚ Game2. This game is the same as Game1, except that the encryption of RKs (e.g., EpKTEE, RKq) is replaced by random ciphertexts. Claim
1. If the signature scheme ΠSig is EUF-CMA, the difference between the adversary’s advantage in Game0 and Game1 is negligible. Proof sketch. Game0 and Game1 are the same unless a forgery event (i.e., the adversary produces a forged signature σ˚ ‰ σ for a modified UL˚ i ‰ ULi, which passes the verification) occurs, given that the freshness of a valid ULi is guaranteed by TEE’s replay protection mechanism. Therefore, there exists a forger F such that |PrrE0s ´ PrrE1s| ď AdvEUF-CMA ΠSig,F . where AdvEUF-CMA ΠSig,F is the advantage of F breaking ΠSig. Claim
2. If EncpKTEE, ¨q (say ΠAE) is a secure authen- ticated encryption scheme [17], the difference between the adversary’s advantage in Game1 and Game2 is negligible. Proof sketch. Suppose there exists an adversary that has a non-negligible advantage for distinguishing Game1 and Game2, it implies that the adversary can distinguish a real ciphertext and a random ciphertext, which contradicts the CCA security of ΠAE. Formally, there exists a simulator B1 such that |PrrE1s ´ PrrE2s| “ AdvCCA ΠAE,B1. 3125 Authorized licensed use limited to: BOSTON UNIVERSITY. Downloaded on October 10,2025 at 13:20:57 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. where AdvCCA ΠAE,B1 is the advantage of B1 breaking ΠAE. Claim
3. If the ABE-2OD scheme is sIND-CDA, the adver- sary’s advantage in Game2 is negligible. Proof. Suppose there exists a PPT adversary A who has a non-negligible advantage in Game2, we build a simulator B that calls A as a subroutine to win sIND-CDA of the ABE-2OD scheme (i.e., Π1). The simulation consists of six phases and the details are as follows. Init. The simulator B runs a copy of A. A determines a policy pM˚, ρ˚q, which is submitted for challenging. Setup. Receiving a public parameter PK1 from Π1’s sIND-CDA challenger, B first generates a random symmet- ric key KTEE, and constructs an initialized DU list UL. Besides, B also runs a copy of the simulated signature scheme pvk, skq Ð ΠSig.KeyGenp1λq. Then B maintains the MSK “ pd, sk, KTEEq privately, where ‘d’ denotes unknown master secret key in Π1. B also maintains variables UL “ H, and st0, which is produced in a similar way as in oracle OUpdpMSK,UL,¨,¨q. Finally, B forwards pMPK, st0q to the adversary, where MPK “ pPK1, vkq. Query Phase
1. We use Poseidon
[38] to instantiate a hash for Merkle trees, as well as commitments. Finally, we assume that the key-prefixed Poseidon hash function, used to instantiate the gadgets in Section 5.3, is a PRF. As Poseidon is a sponge construction, prefixing is secure. Separately, see

2. Since π(i) ≤31 and 231 < N, no entry is reduced modulo N such that v ∈Z32. Therefore, computing the log2 of v element-wise yields the values of π(0), . . . , π(31) and thus discloses the secret permutation π. Using Matrix A. We now present a second attack that only requires access to the hard-coded values A, α, β deﬁning the two matrices A and M. We can directly read off A from Algorithm
